## INTRODUCTION

Millions of passengers use government buses as their mode of transport, but still, there is no proper
application which tracks all the required data, Here comes BUS YATRA, a mobile application
which will help in tracking thebusâ€™ss current location, helping the government and bus operators
to keep the records of the passengers travelled and the total fare amount generated, the application
will also make the payments easier by making all the payments digital. So our main goal is to make
bus travel an organised and comfortable mode of transport.
